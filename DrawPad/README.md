# DrawPad

In this tutorial, you will create an app very much like Color Pad for iPhone. In the process youâ€™ll learn how to:
 - draw lines and strokes using Quartz2D,
 - use multiple colors,
 - set brush stroke widths and opacity,
 - create an eraser,
 - create a custom RGB color selector, and
 - share your drawing!
