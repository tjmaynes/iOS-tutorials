# TodoApp

> Learning swift by building a TodoApp. Originally, started the project by learning from the [Test Driven Development with Swift](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Swift-Dominik-Hauser/dp/178588073X) book from Dominik Hauser, but eventually became a playground for other things.
